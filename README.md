# How to play the game
For a varying amount of time, 4 random neopixel colors will pop up.
- Blue
- Yellow
- Green
- Purple

Your job is to:
Press the button corresponding to the neopixel color.
- Press the left button for a blue neopixel
- Press the right button for a yellow neopixel
- Press both for a purple neopixel
- Press none for a green neopixel

If you don't input the correct command in the given amount of time, the neopixel will turn red and you will lose a life.
Once you lose 3 lives, the game is over. 
Your score, life count, and highscore is kept track of in the serial monitor.

Enjoy!
